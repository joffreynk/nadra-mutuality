the following code to generate member ID:
async function generateMainMemberCode() {
  const members = await prisma.member.findMany({
    where: { isDependent: false },
    orderBy: { id: "asc" }
  });

  const nextNumber = members.length + 1;
  return `Nadra${String(nextNumber).padStart(4, "0")}`;
}

// Generate a dependent member code, when isdepende is true
async function generateDependentMemberCode(mainMemberId: number) {
  const mainMember = await prisma.member.findUnique({
    where: { id: mainMemberId },
    include: { dependents: true }
  });

  if (!mainMember) throw new Error("Main member not found");

  const dependentCount = mainMember.dependents.length + 1;
  return `${mainMember.memberCode}/${dependentCount}`;
}

then remove cloudinary upload files on under public/uploads on local machine then update database to record link only and remove file id as it is locally stored
update the rest of code and make it work
